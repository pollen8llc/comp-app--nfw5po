Enterprise-grade platform for managing and analyzing community data through advanced graph database technology and network analysis.

## Overview

The Community Management Platform revolutionizes how organizations understand and manage their community relationships through:

- Advanced graph database technology for complex relationship modeling
- Topological Data Analysis (TDA) for deep network insights
- Automated entity disambiguation and profile management
- Comprehensive event platform integration
- Interactive network visualization
