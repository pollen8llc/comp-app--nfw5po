## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ LTS
- pnpm 8+
- Neo4j 5+ Enterprise Edition
- Redis 7+ Enterprise
- Docker 24+ for containerized tests
- Chrome 90+ for E2E tests
- Firefox 88+ for cross-browser testing
- Safari 14+ for iOS compatibility

### Environment Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

2. Configure test environment:
```bash
cp .env.example .env.test
```

3. Start test databases:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up -d
```

### Test Commands

```bash
# Run all test suites
pnpm test

# Run unit tests with coverage
pnpm test:unit

# Run integration tests
pnpm test:integration

# Run E2E tests
pnpm test:e2e

# Run performance tests
pnpm test:performance

# Run security tests
pnpm test:security

# Watch mode for development
pnpm test:watch

# Generate coverage reports
pnpm test:report

# Clean test artifacts
pnpm test:clean
```

## Test Guidelines

### Coverage Requirements

- Branch coverage: 80% minimum
- Function coverage: 80% minimum
- Line coverage: 80% minimum
- Statement coverage: 80% minimum
- Critical paths: 100% coverage
- Entity disambiguation: 95% coverage
- Authentication flows: 100% coverage
- Data protection: 100% coverage

### Performance Benchmarks

| Operation | Target Response Time | Max Load | Degradation Point |
|-----------|---------------------|----------|-------------------|
| Graph Query (Simple) | <200ms | 1000 qps | 2000 qps |
| Graph Query (Complex) | <1s | 100 qps | 200 qps |
| Entity Disambiguation | <500ms | 50 rps | 100 rps |
| TDA Computation | <5s | 10 rps | 20 rps |
| Event Import | <30s | 5 rps | 10 rps |
| Network Visualization | <2s | 100 rps | 200 rps |

### Security Guidelines

1. **Data Protection**
   - Test data must be anonymized
   - Sensitive data must be encrypted
   - PII must be handled according to GDPR requirements

2. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Validate JWT token handling
   - Test role-based access control
   - Verify session management
   - Test OAuth2.0 flows

3. **Input Validation**
   - Test against SQL injection
   - Validate XSS prevention
   - Verify CSRF protection
   - Test file upload security

4. **Environment Security**
   - Test environments must be isolated
   - Secrets must be securely managed
   - SSL/TLS must be enforced
   - Security headers must be validated

## Monitoring & Reporting

### Test Development Guidelines

1. Follow the test naming convention:
   - Unit tests: `*.test.ts`
   - Integration tests: `*.integration.test.ts`
   - E2E tests: `*.cy.ts`

2. Maintain test isolation:
   - Clean up test data
   - Reset mocks between tests
   - Use unique identifiers

3. Write maintainable tests:
   - Use page objects for E2E tests
   - Share test utilities
   - Document complex scenarios
